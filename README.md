Usage instructions:

If required dependencies are installed (on any system), simply run 'python3 main.py':
    -NumPy
    -SciPy
    -SciKit-learn

On linux, with python >= 3.3 installed:
    extract files to appropriate file location
    navigate to file location
    type 'venv/bin/python3.5 main.py'

    OR
     
    enter the virtual environment directly with 'venv/bin/activate'
    and run the file with 'python3 main.py' or 'python main.py' depending on your system

    to exit the virtual environment, type 'deactivate'
    
On Windows, with python >= 3.3 installed:
    extract files to appropriate file location
    navigate to file location
    type '.\win_env\Scripts\activate'
    this will run the appropriate file for cmd or powershell, whichever you are using
    with the virtual environment active, type 'python .\main.py'

    to exit the virtual environment, type 'deactivate'

    if you encounter a script permission error, it may be bypassed by changing your system settings in powershell:
	'Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted'
    which you can reset afterwards.
